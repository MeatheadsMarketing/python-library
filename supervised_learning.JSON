The dataset consists of {dataset_type}, and I need the AI to learn the relationship between {input_variable} and {output_variable}. \n\nThe model should:\n1. Process labeled data efficiently.\n2. Learn feature representations from {data_type}.\n3. Minimize errors in classification or regression tasks.\n\nProvide an optimized training strategy, including dataset preprocessing, model architecture selection, and performance evaluation methods.",
